<p align="center">Achievement system plugin for Godot 3.x.x Engine</p>
 

# How to install in your project?
## Copy from GitHub repository
Initially, the plugin is located in the "addons" folder. If your project does not have this folder, you can copy the plugin along with this folder into the project. If you have, copy only "gd-achievements" folder to your current "addons" folder in your project. 

After that don't forget to enable it in "Project Settings -> Plugins"

And add "addons\gd-achievements\scripts\global.gd" file as singletone

# How to add custom achievements?
## 1. Generate JSON via Python script;
Open "achievements_generator.py". To make file, generator require to write main name of your achievement, short description and Godot's path to icon.

Easiest way to get path is pressing right mouse button to you icon and press "copy path".

I recommend to store all icons to "resources/icons" folder from addon ("addons/gd_achievements/resources/icons")

Icon size recommended: 150x150px

## 2. Place your new "achievements.json" to "addons/gd_achievements/resources/data" folder
As you can see, the structure of JSON file is simple and you can use fields like you want.

## 3. Open your Godot project, place "AchievementSystem" node to scene you want

Also, you can change additional node's options from Inspector:
* "Show time" - How much time achievement's notficaton will shown in seconds;
* "Global Sound" - What sound will play for all achievements;
* "Global Sound Volume".

To call achievement, use "showAchievement" signal, that accepts index of your achievement

# Q/A
## I've installed this plugin correctly, but I can't call achievement needed to me. I want to call the "number1"-th achievement but it calls "number2"-th achievement
Keep in mind, that achievements data in game are different that data from original file you created. For example, if in your generated file achievement you need is fifth,
in game this achievement can be a second and e.t.c. To call achievement correctly, first of all you should call getAchievementsAllNames() to see 
what order your achievements are

# I'll accept all problems and suggestions that you write in the repository on GitHub on "Issues" section
